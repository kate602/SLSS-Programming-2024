**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://www.google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

Name      |Age  | Superpower  | Coolness
---       |----   | ----        |----
Batman    | 30-something| Rich/smart | VERY
Mr. Ubial | Pretty old | He can nap anywhere | 100%

To make a list we can use the following:

* This is item one
* This is item two
    * This is a subpoint in the list
        * This is also another subpoint

- This is another list
We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one
2. This is item two
    - This is a **subpoint** under two
3. This is item three

# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quote, things that someone has said

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines

> * This is a list
> * This is the second part of the list in a blockquote 
>
> There is a space above *
